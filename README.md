# Snake-Classification
This project is a deep learning-based snake classification model that identifies whether a given snake is venomous or non-venomous and also predicts the snake species from an image. The model is trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and can assist researchers, herpetologists, and the general public in snake identification
