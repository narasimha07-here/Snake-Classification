# Snake Classification: Venomous or Non-Venomous

## Overview
This project is a deep learning-based snake classification model that identifies whether a given snake is **venomous or non-venomous** and also predicts the **snake species** from an image. The model is trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and can assist researchers, herpetologists, and the general public in snake identification.

## Features
- **Detects venomous or non-venomous snakes** from images
- **Classifies snake species** based on trained dataset
- **Uses deep learning (CNNs) for high accuracy**
- **Trained with PyTorch and Fastai**

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing images of various snake species labeled as venomous or non-venomous. The dataset includes:
- Multiple species of snakes
- High-quality images for training and testing
- Annotations for classification

## Model Details
- **Architecture:** CNN-based model (possibly ResNet, EfficientNet, or a custom model)
- **Framework:** PyTorch & Fastai
- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy for classification
- **Optimizer:** Adam / SGD
- **Training:** Trained on labeled snake images

## Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-classification.git
cd snake-classification

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to test the model with an image:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Load the notebook `snakes_classify.ipynb` and follow the instructions to classify a snake image.

## Example Prediction
```python
from model import predict_snake

image_path = "test_snake.jpg"
species, is_venomous = predict_snake(image_path)
print(f"Species: {species}, Venomous: {is_venomous}")
```

## Results
- The model achieves high accuracy on test data.
- Successfully distinguishes between venomous and non-venomous species.
- Works well in real-world snake identification.
